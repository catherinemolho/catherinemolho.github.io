I am assistant professor at [University of Toulouse 1 Capitole](https://www.ut-capitole.fr/){:target="\_blank"} and member of the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/){:target="\_blank"}.

I am generally interested in social evolution, collective action problems, and their mathematical modeling.
