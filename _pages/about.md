I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Research in Experimental Economics and Political Decision Making (CREED)](https://www.creedexperiment.nl/creed/){:target="\_blank"}, in the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-economics-and-business/faculty-of-economics-and-business.html){:target="\_blank"}. I am currently also affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research aims to answer key questions about human cooperation and ethical decision-making. Which interdependent situations are conducive to cooperation? What are the factors - emotional, relational, personality - that drive people's direct and indirect punishment of unethical behaviors? How do institutions that support collective action emerge from people's interactions?

As part of my work at the [Behavioral Ethics Lab](https://www.behavioralethics.org/){:target="\_blank"} in the University of Amsterdam, I study how informational ambiguity affects people's cooperative and ethical decisions. When do people take advantage of ambiguity to make self-serving decisions? Can transparency ensure more ethical decisions in the context of the [sharing economy](https://www.behavioralethics.org/project/trustpath/){:target="\_blank"}?
