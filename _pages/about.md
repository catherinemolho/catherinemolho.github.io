I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Behavioral Ethics Lab](https://www.behavioralethics.org/){:target="\_blank"} and the [Center for Research in Experimental Economics and Political Decision Making (CREED)](https://www.creedexperiment.nl/creed/){:target="\_blank"}, at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-economics-and-business/faculty-of-economics-and-business.html){:target="\_blank"}. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research aims to answer key questions about cooperation and ethical decision-making. Which interdependent situations are conducive to cooperation? What are the factors -- emotional, relational, personality -- that drive people's direct and indirect punishment of norm violations? How do institutions for collective action emerge from people's interactions? More recently, my work focuses on understanding how informational ambiguity affects prosocial decisions, and whether transparency can promote more ethical decisions in the context of the sharing economy.

Here is a copy of my [CV](https://catherinemolho.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_CMolho.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.
