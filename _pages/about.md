I am an incoming assistant professor in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/groups/department-social-and-behavioral-sciences?tabs=0){:target="\_blank"}.

Previously, I worked as an assistant professor in the Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology at the [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-behavioural-and-movement-sciences/departments/experimental-and-applied-psychology){:target="\_blank"} and taught at the [Research Master's in Social Psychology](https://vu.nl/en/education/master/social-psychology-research){:target="\_blank"}. From 2019-2021, I was a research fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse (IAST)](https://www.iast.fr/){:target="\_blank"}. I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Research in Experimental Economics and Political Decision Making ([CREED](https://www.creedexperiment.nl/creed/){:target="\_blank"}), at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-economics-and-business/faculty-of-economics-and-business.html){:target="\_blank"}.

My research aims to answer key questions about cooperation and moral decision-making. Which interdependent situations are conducive to cooperation? What are the factors -- emotional, relational, personality -- that drive people's direct and indirect punishment of norm violations? How do institutions for collective action emerge from people's interactions? To answer these questions, I use diverse methods including behavioral experiments, experience sampling, and cross-cultural surveys.

Here is a copy of my [CV](https://catherinemolho.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_CMolho.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.
